🔹 Setup Section
Line 1
local DAMAGE = 5
This is how much health the player loses each time the damage repeats.
Line 2
local DELAY = 1
This is the time (in seconds) between each damage hit.
Line 3
local part = script.Parent
This stores the exact part the script is inside.
This is your DrainHealthZone.
Line 5
local playersInZone = {}
This table remembers which players are inside the drain zone so we don’t damage them twice.
🔹 Player Touches the Zone
Line 9
part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
Runs when anything touches the part.
Line 10
    local hum = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
Looks for a Humanoid, meaning “is this a character?”
Line 11
    if hum == nil then return end
If there’s no Humanoid → stop (it’s not a player).
Line 13
    local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
Turns the character model into the actual Player object.
Line 14
    if player == nil then return end
If it’s not a real player (example: NPC) → stop.
Line 17
    if playersInZone[player] then return end
If this player is already being damaged → don’t start again.
Line 18
    playersInZone[player] = true
Mark the player as “inside the zone.”
🔹 Start Damaging the Player
Line 21
    task.spawn(function()
Starts a new mini-thread so the loop runs separately.
Line 22
        while playersInZone[player] do
Keep damaging the player as long as the player stays inside.
Line 23
            hum:TakeDamage(DAMAGE)
Actually lowers the player’s health.
Line 24
            task.wait(DELAY)
Wait the chosen delay before repeating damage.
Line 25–26
        end
    end)
End the loop and the spawned thread.
Line 27
end)
Ends the Touched event.
🔹 Player Leaves the Zone
Line 31
part.TouchEnded:Connect(function(hit)
Runs when something stops touching the part.
Line 32
    local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
Check if the thing leaving is a real player.
Line 33–35
    if player ~= nil then
        playersInZone[player] = nil
    end
If it's a player → remove them from the table →
This automatically stops the damage loop.
Line 36
end)
Ends the TouchEnded event.
✅ FINAL SUMMARY (kid-friendly)
When the player walks into the zone → they get added to the table.
A loop starts hurting them every DELAY seconds.
When they walk out → they’re removed → loop stops.
Super simple, easy to understand, fully safe.
